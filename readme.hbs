# URL Util

A simple class for parsing and dealing with URLs.

## Developing

Install necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.

To build the project simply run `gulp`. This will run babel on the JS and export bundles to the dist/ folder. This also updates README.md with the latest API documentation.
